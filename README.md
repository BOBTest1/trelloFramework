# Test-Automation-Framework Training
Web Applications
Create a test automation framework providing the capability to functionally test a web-based application. Trello (www.trello.com ) is the preferred web-based application, you can choose any website that we would realistically test for a client. Typical examples include any E-Commerce applications, but any framework must not attempt to complete fraudulent transactions.

The test automation framework must:

Follow the Page Object Model design pattern.
Use a suitable test tool to interface between the framework and the web browser.
Selenium WebDriver is an example of a suitable test tool for interacting with a web application.
Provide cross-browser testing capabilities.
Contain enough test cases to demonstrate a thorough understanding of testing web-based applications.
Execute tests on a remote device.
